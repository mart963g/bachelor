Format specification of frames and headers in custom FLAC/Audiopak/Shorten implementation.

Metadata:
Wave header will be put uncompressed in the compressed file, with the ASCII letters "FLAK" in front of it, in the compressed file.
From here the decompresser will read stuff like sample bit depth, number of channels, and number of samples per frame.
Possibly the number of zero value samples appended to the end of the last frame. 

METADATA FORMAT:
<4> The string "FLAK" ascii encoded
<44> The original uncompressed WAV header

Frame:
A frame has a header. The frame header needs to show which channel it is displaying data for.
This could also just be implicit from the order.
The frame header also needs to display which order predictor was used (from 0 to 3, only 2 bits needed), and the Golomb parameter k.


FRAME HEADER FORMAT:
<1> A flag set to 1, if this is one of the last frames, and it contains a different number of samples than the previous frames
<1> Shows which channel. 0 = left, 1 = right. In case of mono sound, this is always 0.
<2> Shows which predictor order was used. Number p from 0 to 3.
<4> The golomb parameter k. For early testing purposes this is 0. 
<0 || 16> If the first flag is set, then this is the number of samples in the frame (Little endian signed short). Otherwise this field is skipped
<16*p> The first p samples, where p is the predictor order. (Little endian signed short)


NOTE:
A frame here follows the frame concept from the Audiopak paper. This mostly resembles a subframe in the FLAC format.
