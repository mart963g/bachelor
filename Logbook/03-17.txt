I have completed the LZ77 compression. Only test is a homemade
small txt file, but this eases the testing since i can keep
track of how each token is supposed to look. History buffer
size is defaulted to 10 bytes, and lookahead buffer size
is defaulted to 5. 
For now the offset and the length of the match, are in a
full byte each. This means that the history buffer can not
be longer than 256 bytes.
