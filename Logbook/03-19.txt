I have finished the decompression for LZ77. Most of the work
was done yesterday, with only some final bug fixes to make it
all work today.
I am considering to change the reading and writing of the token,
such that in the two bytes, such that 11 bits are used for the offset
and 5 bits are used for the length. In this way the history buffer could
have a much bigger size, that would also match the real world implementations
without changing the size of the token.
